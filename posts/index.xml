This will also go over some ways these barriers can be broken.</p>
<h2 id="language-barrier">Language Barrier</h2>
<p>Not everyone in the world speaks the same language and will be able to understand yours, meaning that people who speak a different language to you won&rsquo;t be able to understand your message. One way to get around this would to be to hire translators to translate what you are saying to the people who cannot understand. Alternately, translation software could be used to do this automatically.</p>
<h2 id="auditory-impairment">Auditory Impairment</h2>
<p>Many people struggle with their hearing which could make it hard for them to understand what you are saying, or they may not even be able to hear you at all. This means they won&rsquo;t be able to understand the message you are trying to deliver. A few ways to overcome this barrier would be to hire an interpreter who can do sign language for the audience, or you could use dictatory software which will understand what you are saying and display subtitles on a screen for the hearing impaired to use. Alternately, a hearing-aid microphone could be used to assist their hearing.</p>
<h2 id="background-noise">Background Noise</h2>
<p>If there is lots of noise in the background whilst you are presenting, it will make it hard for your audience to listen and for them to stay engaged with your presentation. This can be overcome by making sure you do your presentation in a quiet area. Devices such as air conditioning or fans may also contribute to this - if they can be turned off, they should.</p>
<h2 id="distractions">Distractions</h2>
<p>If there is noise from people talking in the audience or if phones are constantly going off, it will make it hard for the audience to stay focused with your presentation. Make sure everyone attending knows their devices should be off and not speak loudly if they need to talk to someone else in the audience. Also ensure people who may need to leave late or arrive late are known beforehand so they can be assisted when leaving so they do not cause a disruption.</p>
<h2 id="lack-of-engagement">Lack of Engagement</h2>
<p>If your presentation / delivery isn&rsquo;t done with enthusiasm and excitement or any audience interaction, it will cause your audience to become disinterested in your message meaning they will stop listening. Ensure that your delivery is done with positive body language and with a lively and excited appearance. Also make sure your presentation gives a chance for the audience to participate and give them a chance to voice their opinions.</p>
