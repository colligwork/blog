Whilst presenting or tyring to communicate a message, there are often many barriers and issues that must be considered before presenting to ensure that your communication is effective. This will also go over some ways these barriers can be broken.

## Language Barrier
Not everyone in the world speaks the same language and will be able to understand yours, meaning that people who speak a different language to you won't be able to understand your message. One way to get around this would to be to hire translators to translate what you are saying to the people who cannot understand. Alternately, translation software could be used to do this automatically.

## Auditory Impairment
Many people struggle with their hearing which could make it hard for them to understand what you are saying, or they may not even be able to hear you at all. This means they won't be able to understand the message you are trying to deliver. A few ways to overcome this barrier would be to hire an interpreter who can do sign language for the audience, or you could use dictatory software which will understand what you are saying and display subtitles on a screen for the hearing impaired to use. Alternately, a hearing-aid microphone could be used to assist their hearing.

## Background Noise
If there is lots of noise in the background whilst you are presenting, it will make it hard for your audience to listen and for them to stay engaged with your presentation. This can be overcome by making sure you do your presentation in a quiet area. Devices such as air conditioning or fans may also contribute to this - if they can be turned off, they should.

## Distractions
If there is noise from people talking in the audience or if phones are constantly going off, it will make it hard for the audience to stay focused with your presentation. Make sure everyone attending knows their devices should be off and to not speak loudly if they need to talk to someone else in the audience. Also ensure people who may need to leave late or arrive late are known beforehand so they can be assisted so they do not cause a disruption.

## Lack of Engagement
If your presentation / delivery isn't done with enthusiasm and excitement or any audience interaction, it will cause your audience to become disinterested in your message meaning they will stop listening. Ensure that your delivery is done with positive body language and with a lively and excited attitude. Also make sure your presentation gives a chance for the audience to participate and give them a chance to voice their opinions.

## Technology Failures
There is always a chance that there could be a power outage or the computer you are using to present crashes, your internet goes out, and many more. Whilst mitigating all of these could be hard, you should always have backup plans just in case. Some mitigations could be: use a laptop so if power is lost, the laptop wont shutdown; have a printed version of the presentation prepared in case the projector fails, use a UPS to keep power if there is an outage; have a spare computer if one fails.

## Not Speaking Clearly
If you are mumbling, slurring or stuttering your words it may make it harder for your audience to understand what you are saying. Whilst if there is a medical problem this cannot be helped, but ensure that you speak confidently and as clearly as you can whilst presenting.

## Lack of Structure 
If there is not a clear structure to your presentation, it will make it hard for your audience to understand and follow. Ensure that everything is checked before the presentation to ensure that your slides are in the correct order, and everything flows into each other.

## Lack of Organization / Lack of Time
Make sure that all your presentations are delivered with enough time to get it all finished. Make sure you pick a date and time where you know you will be available so there is no rushing throughout the delivery. You must also ensure you plan everything you will present in advance and have anything needed for the presentation prepared before the presentation is meant to begin. 

## Lack of Knowledge of the Topic
If you are delivering a presentation about IT to a non-IT audience, make sure you only use terminology that the audience will be able to understand. For example, using specialist IT terms to the audience would be no use as they would not know what that word means. If you are making any words simpler, make sure itâ€™s not done in a patronising way as it may disengage your audience and make them feel like they are not respected.
